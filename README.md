# Description
Inspired by classic fictional media of suits of armor that "come to life," Mechcloud Chemwalkers is a race mod that allows for the creation and domination of suits of armor that have been seized and animated by mechanites. These so called Mechclouds inhabit the hollow suits and give them the ability to be autonomous. In order to maintain control and have sufficient energy to act, these clouds consume chemfuel.

A Mechcloud Chemwalker or their larger Lumbering Chemwalker variant can be created by players by assembling a simple suit of armor, or "shell", at a fueled smithy, ritually inscribing that shell with symbols to imbue it with a latent power, and setting it outside to accumulate mechanites and psychic power from the environment. Once sufficient power is gained, a psycaster of any kind can commune with the stirring mechcloud to dominate it psychically, forcing it to obey the commands of its new master. Once communed in this way, the chemwalker will obediently follow every order without question or a thought of its own until destroyed.

## Features
* Multiple races: Roughly one per tech-tier, corresponding to armor from that era. Each has differing stats, and some have more unique traits.
* A new research locked behind techprints possessed by tribals or the Empire that will allow players to create chemwalkers (these factions do not currently use the races due to compatibility concerns and development time required).
* Recipes/workflow necessary to build the chemwalkers:
    - At a fueled smithy (Not an electric one!), create an uninscribed shell of the desired variant with the chemfuel necessary to lure mechanites to the armor.
    - At an art work bench, inscribe the shell to etch meaning and power into the armor.
    - Take the inscribed shell outside and set it down in a natural environment to accumulate mechanites and absorb psychic power. The process is greatly hastened by proximity to an Anima Tree, and slowed by artificial entities (including other shells, which siphon away mechanites and power).
    - When the shell has accumulated its power, use a psycaster pawn to attune the armor to their will, and raise an eternally loyal servant.
* Killed Chemwalkers drop wrecked shells, which can be fixed and turned into uninscribed shells at a discount, allowing destroyed chemwalkers to take up their charge once again much quicker.
* Chemwalkers cannot be tended to or operated upon with any kind of medicine, as they are mere suits of armor. The mechcloud will slowly repair injuries but not lost pieces of armor.
* As suits of armor themselves, chemwalkers cannot wear armor of any kind. They also lack any sort of autonomy, and are purely drone intelligence servants to their masters.

## Known Issues / Incompatibilities
* No known issues yet.
